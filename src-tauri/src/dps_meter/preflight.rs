//! Everything that must be true before the meter can capture.
//!
//! Two ideas drive this module.
//!
//! First, a backend that *exists* is not a backend that *works*. Upstream
//! decided Npcap was present by loading `wpcap.dll`, which keeps succeeding
//! after the driver service is stopped or the adapter list goes empty -- a
//! naive check would wave the user into an app that can never see a packet.
//! Here the probe talks to the driver.
//!
//! Second, not every failure deserves to stop anyone. Capture needs *one*
//! backend, not both, so WinDivert missing while Npcap works is a footnote, not
//! an alarm. [`Weight`] carries that distinction to the UI, which shows these
//! checks as a banner in the main window (TASK-11) rather than a separate gate
//! that blocks entry -- `run_preflight` is read-only now, so nothing holds a
//! "passed" flag any more.
