# DBAion2 DPS — working notes

A real-time DPS meter for AION 2, aimed at the global servers. Rebranded from Aether — itself a
fork of [NOIA2](https://github.com/ZDYoung0519/NOIA2) (GPL-3.0) — for dbaion2.ru; see
[docs/DBAION2.md](./docs/DBAION2.md) for that rebrand. Rust + Tauri 2 backend, React 19 +
TypeScript frontend.

Read [FORK.md](./FORK.md) for what Aether itself diverges from NOIA2 on and why — most of the
architecture notes below still apply verbatim, since the rebrand touched branding, theming, i18n
and links, not the capture/parsing engine.

## Commands

PowerShell 5.1 on the development machine has no `&&` — chain with `;`.

```
pnpm install
pnpm build                        # tsc + vite, ~6s
cd src-tauri; cargo test --lib    # 108 tests
pnpm tauri:dev                    # must be an ELEVATED terminal
pnpm tauri:build                  # NSIS installer + updater bundle
```

`pnpm tauri:dev` fails with OS error 740 outside an Administrator terminal:
packet capture needs elevation, and the Windows manifest demands it.

## Quality gates

**`pnpm check` fails on a clean checkout** — Prettier flags 119 files, ESLint
reports 65 errors, all inherited from upstream. **Never run `pnpm format`**: it
rewrites those files and makes every future upstream merge expensive.

The gates that mean something:

```
pnpm build
cd src-tauri; cargo test --lib
```

`cargo test` without `--lib` fails on the binary target only, because the test
runner cannot launch an executable that demands elevation.

## Conventions

- **Comments and logs in English**, everywhere.
- Keep diffs against upstream **small and anchored**. Upstream is still active,
  and `git fetch upstream && git merge upstream/main` should stay cheap.
- Files use **CRLF** with `core.autocrlf=true`. Scripts that rewrite files must
  preserve CRLF, or the diff becomes a whole-file rewrite.
- Moving the project directory requires `cargo clean` — Cargo and Tauri bake
  absolute paths into `src-tauri/target`.
- Path alias `@/` maps to `src/`.

## Layout

| Path | What lives there |
|---|---|
| `src-tauri/src/dps_meter/capture/` | Capture, TCP reassembly, dispatch, opcode parsing |
| `src-tauri/src/dps_meter/capture/recorder.rs` | Packet recording and replay |
| `src-tauri/src/dps_meter/capture/census.rs` | Opcode census |
| `src-tauri/src/dps_meter/region.rs` | Region profiles and traffic observations |
| `src-tauri/src/dps_meter/preflight.rs` | Startup gate: what must be true before the app opens |
| `src-tauri/src/dps_meter/engine/` | DPS calculation, meter lifecycle |
| `src-tauri/src/plugins/` | Overlay windows, tray, logger, shortcuts |
| `src/games/aion2/` | Game UI, overlay windows (meter, detail, history, PvP, log, chat), bundled game data |
| `src/components/` | Shared UI, including Settings → Aion 2 and the Connection panel |
| `src/i18n/locales/` | English and Korean only |
| `docs/` | `AION2_PACKET_PROTOCOL_ANALYSIS.zh-CN.md` — upstream's protocol notes, in Chinese. Useful reference; not yet translated. |

## Things that will bite you

- **There is no cloud.** Upstream's Supabase account, leaderboard upload, and
  deep-link sign-in were removed in 2.2.0; everything is local. A merge from
  upstream that brings them back should be resolved by dropping them again.
- **Region profiles are load-bearing.** A server id is used *structurally* to
  locate fields inside player-info packets. Upstream hardcoded Taiwan's catalogue,
  which silently named no players anywhere else. Since 2.2.0 the profile is
  always `Auto`; there is no picker.
- **No window calls on the meter's threads.** `stop_dps_meter` runs on the main
  thread and joins the snapshot thread; a window getter there (`is_visible`)
  waits on the main thread. Post window work with `run_on_main_thread`, as
  `aion2_focus::set_dps_idle_hidden_for_app` does. See FORK.md, *The meter
  between fights*.
- **English only.** Bundled data carries no Chinese: `npc_names_en.json` is
  built by `scripts/build-npc-names.mjs` from Kuroukihime's GPL data, and a
  test fails if a Han character appears in it. Regenerate rather than edit by
  hand when names change.
- **Overlays carry their own defaults.** They are separate HTML+JS entry points
  with their own config fallbacks and their own tiny i18n module. Changing an
  app-level default does not reach them.
- **Two different lists decide what ships.** `scripts/copy-windivert-runtime.ps1`
  copies the WinDivert files into `src-tauri/target/<profile>/` for local runs;
  `bundle.resources` in `tauri.conf.json` decides what the *installer* carries.
  They drifted apart once already and the driver went missing from every install
  while working perfectly for whoever built it. Anything a released build needs
  at runtime belongs in both.
- **The startup gate is authoritative in Rust, not in the page.** `enter_app`
  re-runs the checks before showing the main window, and `preflight::passed()`
  guards `show_main_window`. Any new path that surfaces the main window has to
  go through it, or it becomes a way around the gate.
- **Tailwind v4 scans `.rs` files too.** A Windows path in a Rust string, like
  `"C:\...\2c40..."`, reads as a CSS hex escape and fails `vite build` with
  `Invalid code point`. Use forward slashes in paths inside Rust sources.
- **Never touch a game's process.** No `OpenProcess` on another program
  (names come from `plugins::process_names`, a Toolhelp snapshot), no
  `sysinfo` refresh of all processes (`System::new_all()` opens every
  process with `PROCESS_VM_READ` and reads its memory), no injection, input,
  or hooks. WinDivert is opened only when Npcap cannot capture, and unloaded
  when the last handle closes. See FORK.md, *Staying clear of anti-cheat*.
- **Always on top touches other programs' windows.** Every change goes through
  `plugins/on_top` so it is recorded and undone on unpin, exit, update, and the
  next start after a crash. Browsers are launched through Explorer, never
  elevated. See FORK.md.
- **A global `listen()` hears events addressed to every window.** Tauri
  registers it for target `Any`, and an `Any` listener receives `emit_to`
  events meant for other windows too. A page that must only see its own
  window's events listens with `getCurrentWebviewWindow().listen`. In 2.1.0
  every chat pop-up drew the other pop-ups' chats because of this.
- **Overlays are `.js`.** Two consequences, both of which have already caused
  bugs. `tsc` does not check them, so always run the full `pnpm build` rather
  than `tsc --noEmit`. And any repo-wide scan — renaming, translating, auditing —
  must include `*.js`, or the overlays are silently skipped. That is how
  "NoiA METER" survived a rename: `overlay/meter/main.js` sets the title at
  runtime, overwriting the HTML.

## The overlays are `.js`, so nothing type-checks them

`tsc` does not see `src/games/aion2/overlay/**/*.js`, and those files are full of
`try/catch` blocks. An undefined identifier there is a runtime `ReferenceError`
that a catch swallows, so the symptom is a button that does nothing rather than
an error anyone can see. Two shipped bugs came from exactly this:

- the meter never imported `emit`, and passed it an undeclared `payload`, so
  clicking a second player never switched the detail window;
- `load` was declared inside `init()` but called from a module-scope handler, so
  **Delete all history** deleted the records and then reported failure.

```
pnpm check:undef
```

Run it with `pnpm build` and `cargo test --lib`. It is `no-undef` only — it does
not touch the 65 inherited ESLint errors, and it must stay that way to remain
usable.
